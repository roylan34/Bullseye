## Bull's Eye (Swift)

### Introduction

Bull's Eye is a iOS application developed using Swift, Apple's new programming language. It's a fairly simple app - a number is randomly generated, the player has to place a bull's eye on a slider, and they earn points based on how close the bull's eye is to the number. The player can continue to play and accumulate points and can also reset the game.
